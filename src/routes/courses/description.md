I am lucky enough to teach a bunch of courses with my friends at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com). We've been working together since 2016. Before I was a teacher, I was a customer back when I was learning the ropes. I can't recommend them highly enough. Below, I've listed out some of the courses that I've taught over the last few years. You can find the most up-to-date list [here](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/steve-kinney/).
