description: A somewhat-complete list of courses that Steve has taught with Frontend Masters.

I am lucky enough to teach a bunch of courses with my friends at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com). We've been working together since 2016. Well before I was a teacher with them, I was a customer—kind of like the [Hair Club for Men](https://www.hairclub.com/)—insofar that I was a customer way before I was an instructor, but with JavaScript instead of insecurity. Anyway, I can't recommend them highly enough. Below, I've listed out some of the courses that I've taught over the last few years.
