I write a lot of words, but most of them are for the [courses](/courses) that I teach with my friends at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) or in some other pseudo-professional capacity. That said I've occasionally mustered up the will power and discipline to write a few words that I'm _not_ being paid for. This is a complete—if underwhelming—list. Please accept my apologies in advance.
